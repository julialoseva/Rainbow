## At a Glance

`Rainbow` gives you set of colors listed in [Google Material](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation) guidelines. With `Rainbow` you can pick a color from ready collection instead of copying hexademical values into your `colors.xml`.

```javascript
allprojects {
 repositories {

    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
 }
}
```

Then add `Rainbow` to dependencies list:

```javascript
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.julialoseva:Rainbow:1.0.5'
}
```
